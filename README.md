# Coursera_Regression_Course_Project

This is the course project assignment for the Regression Module of the John Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

The data set was the mpg set that comes with R.

There were two questions:
  1. Is there a quantifiable difference in MPG between automatic and manual cars?
  2. Is automatic or manual transmission better for gas milage?

The answer may surprise you...
